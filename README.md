This code simulates a race between a turtle and a rabbit. Here's how it works:

The code initializes two variables: turtle_steps with a value of 1, representing the number of steps the turtle has taken, and rabbit_steps with a value of 100, representing the number of steps the rabbit has taken.

The while loop is initiated with the condition turtle_steps <= rabbit_steps. This means the loop will continue as long as the turtle has taken fewer steps than or equal to the rabbit.

Inside the loop, turtle_steps is incremented by 1 using the += operator. This represents the turtle taking one step forward.

The code then prints the current positions of the turtle and the rabbit using the print statement. It displays the message "Turtle is at [turtle_steps] and rabbit is at [rabbit_steps]". The values of turtle_steps and rabbit_steps are included in the message using string concatenation.

Once the loop condition becomes false (i.e., when turtle_steps becomes greater than rabbit_steps), the else block is executed.

Inside the else block, there is an if statement to determine the winner. If turtle_steps is greater than rabbit_steps, it means the turtle has surpassed the rabbit and won the race. In this case, the code prints "Turtle Won!".

If the if condition is not met, it means the rabbit has won the race. The code prints "Rabbit Won!".

Overall, the code tracks the steps taken by the turtle and the rabbit, and it continues the simulation until the turtle surpasses the rabbit. Once the race is over, it determines the winner based on the final positions of the turtle and the rabbit.
